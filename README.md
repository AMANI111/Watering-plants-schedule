I created this script because my local allotment needed help keeping up with the watering demands of the plants as we enter warmer seasons.
The eagerness of the members and a lack of scheduling resulted in the plants being overwatered.
This is aimed at being a solution; Firstly to create the reminder of a task needing to be done but passing the task to the next member only if the task was not completed.
This ideally should prevent overwatering.

Things I would add to this code;
Scheduling the plant task at certain times of the day
Add real notifications using SMS
When a plant is watered, disable the task reminders the following day as it would not be necessary to water plants two days in a row.
